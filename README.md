# nixos
My nixOS configuration files

Currently in the ricing process, trying to create an Cyberpunk Arasaka themed desktop

## Todos:
- [x] Basic, but aesthetic waybar
- [x] Cursor changed
- [ ] Terminal theme
- [ ] Neovim setup for development
- [ ] Direnv set up
- [ ] Finish configuring hyprland and move to a nix based configuration


Credits:

When customising my waybar I heavily relied on the mechabar preset made by the github user "sejjy", parts of the code are copied from that repo, all credit to them for the bar. Link to the repo below:
